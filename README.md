## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure software. It allows for modular, reusable, and maintainable code. This repository provides an in-depth look at OOP concepts to help you master this paradigm.

## Object and Classes

### Objects

An object is an instance of a class. It is a self-contained component that contains properties and methods needed to make a certain type of data useful.

### Classes

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a datatype by bundling data and methods that work on the data into one single unit.

## Four Main Pillars of OOP

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.

### Abstraction

Abstraction means hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of the object.

### Inheritance

Inheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. It helps in reusability and adds a relationship between the new class and the existing class.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even though they share the same name.

## Examples

This section contains code examples to illustrate the OOP concepts discussed above.

- [Example 1: Encapsulation](examples/encapsulation.md)
- [Example 2: Abstraction](examples/abstraction.md)
- [Example 3: Inheritance](examples/inheritance.md)
- [Example 4: Polymorphism](examples/polymorphism.md)

## Conclusion

OOP is a powerful paradigm that can make your code more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain. By understanding and applying these concepts, you can create more efficient and scalable software.
